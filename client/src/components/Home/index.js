              <Copy>
                The founders of Farm Envy come from both sides of the CSA process.
                Farmers with more than 10 years of experience running an active CSA
                and customers that know what is expected from the sign-up process.

              <Copy>
                We understand that growing the produce is often the fun and easy part
                but managing a successful CSA can be the hardest and most stressful part
                of all. Farm Envy simplifies this process in one user-friendly site.
                We have taken all of our frustrations and have created the solution.
